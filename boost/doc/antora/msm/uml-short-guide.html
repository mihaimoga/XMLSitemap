<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>State machines are the description of a thing&#8217;s lifeline. They describe
the different stages of the lifeline, the events influencing it, and
what it does when a particular event is detected at a particular stage.
They offer the complete specification of the dynamic behavior of the
thing.</p>

<h2 id="concepts"><a class="anchor" href="#concepts"></a>Concepts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thinking in terms of state machines is a bit surprising at first, so let
us have a quick glance at the concepts.</p>

<h2 id="state-machine-state-transition-event"><a class="anchor" href="#state-machine-state-transition-event"></a>State machine, state, transition, event</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A state machine is a concrete model describing the behavior of a system.
It is composed of a finite number of states and transitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/sm.gif" alt="image"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple state has no sub states. It can have data, entry and exit
behaviors and deferred events. One can provide entry and exit behaviors
(also called actions) to states (or state machines), which are executed
whenever a state is entered or left, no matter how. A state can also
have internal transitions which cause no entry or exit behavior to be
called. A state can mark events as deferred. This means the event cannot
be processed if this state is active, but it must be retained. Next time
a state not deferring this event is active, the event will be processed,
as if it had just been fired.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/state.gif" alt="image"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A transition is the switching between active states, triggered by an
event. Actions and guard conditions can be attached to the transition.
The action executes when the transition fires, the guard is a Boolean
operation executed first and which can prevent the transition from
firing by returning false.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/transition.jpg" alt="image"></span></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An initial state marks the first active state of a state machine. It has
no real existence and neither has the transition originating from it.</p>

<h2 id="submachines-orthogonal-regions-pseudostates"><a class="anchor" href="#submachines-orthogonal-regions-pseudostates"></a>Submachines, orthogonal regions, pseudostates</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A composite state is a state containing a region or decomposed in two or
more regions. A composite state contains its own set of states and
regions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A submachine is a state machine inserted as a state in another state
machine. The same submachine can be inserted more than once.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Orthogonal regions are parts of a composite state or submachine, each
having its own set of mutually exclusive set of states and transitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/regions.gif" alt="image"></span> UML also defines a number of pseudo
states, which are considered important concepts to model, but not enough
to make them first-class citizens. The terminate pseudo state terminates
the execution of a state machine (MSM handles this slightly differently;
the state machine is not destroyed but no further event processing
occurs).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/terminate.gif" alt="image"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An exit point pseudo state exits a composite state or a submachine and
forces termination of execution in all contained regions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/exit.gif" alt="image"></span> An entry point pseudo state allows a kind
of controlled entry inside a composite. Precisely, it connects a
transition outside the composite to a transition inside the composite.
An important point is that this mechanism only allows a single region to
be entered. In the above diagram, in region1, the initial state would
become active.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/entry_point.gif" alt="image"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also two more ways to enter a submachine (apart the obvious
and more common case of a transition terminating on the submachine as
shown in the region case). An explicit entry means that an inside state
is the target of a transition. Unlike with direct entry, no tentative
encapsulation is made, and only one transition is executed. An explicit
exit is a transition from an inner state to a state outside the
submachine (not supported by MSM). I would not recommend using explicit
entry or exit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/explicit.gif" alt="image"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last entry possibility is using fork. A fork is an explicit entry
into one or more regions. Other regions are again activated using their
initial state.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_history"><a class="anchor" href="#_history"></a><a id="uml-history"></a>History</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>UML defines two kinds of history, shallow history and deep history.
Shallow history is a pseudo state representing the most recent substate
of a submachine. A submachine can have at most one shallow history. A
transition with a history pseudo state as target is equivalent to a
transition with the most recent substate as target. And very
importantly, only one transition may originate from the history. Deep
history is a shallow history recursively reactivating the substates of
the most recent substate. It is represented like the shallow history
with a star (H* inside a circle).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/history.gif" alt="image"></span> History is not a completely satisfying
concept. First of all, there can be just one history pseudo state and
only one transition may originate from it. So they do not mix well with
orthogonal regions as only one region can be ``remembered''. Deep
history is even worse and looks like a last-minute addition. History has
to be activated by a transition and only one transition originates from
it, so how to model the transition originating from the deep history
pseudo state and pointing to the most recent substate of the substate?
As a bonus, it is also inflexible and does not accept new types of
histories. Let&#8217;s face it, history sounds great and is useful in theory,
but the UML version is not quite making the cut. And therefore, MSM
provides a different version of this useful concept.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="uml-anonymous"><a class="anchor" href="#uml-anonymous"></a>Completion transitions / anonymous transitions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Completion events (or transitions), also called anonymous transitions,
are defined as transitions having no defined event triggering them. This
means that such transitions will immediately fire when a state being the
source of an anonymous transition becomes active, provided that a guard
allows it. They are useful in modeling algorithms as an activity diagram
would normally do. In the real-time world, they have the advantage of
making it easier to estimate how long a periodically executed action
will last. For example, consider the following diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/completion.gif" alt="image"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The designer now knows at any time that he will need a maximum of 4
transitions. Being able to estimate how long a transition takes, he can
estimate how much of a time frame he will need to require (real-time
tasks are often executed at regular intervals). If he can also estimate
the duration of actions, he can even use graph algorithms to better
estimate his timing requirements.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="UML-internal-transition"><a class="anchor" href="#UML-internal-transition"></a>Internal transitions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Internal transitions are transitions executing in the scope of the
active state, being a simple state or a submachine. One can see them as
a self-transition of this state, without an entry or exit action called.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="transition-conflict"><a class="anchor" href="#transition-conflict"></a>Conflicting transitions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If, for a given event, several transitions are enabled, they are said to
be in conflict. There are two kinds of conflicts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a given source state, several transitions are defined, triggered
by the same event. Normally, the guard condition in each transition
defines which one is fired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source state is a submachine or simple state and the conflict is
between a transition internal to this state and a transition triggered
by the same event and having as target another state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first one is simple; one only needs to define two or more rows in
the transition table, with the same source and trigger, with a different
guard condition. Beware, however, that the UML standard wants these
conditions to be not overlapping. If they do, the standard says nothing
except that this is incorrect, so the implementer is free to implement
it the way he sees fit. In the case of MSM, the transition appearing
last in the transition table gets selected first, if it returns false
(meaning disabled), the library tries with the previous one, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/conflict1.gif" alt="image"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the second case, UML defines that the most inner transition gets
selected first, which makes sense, otherwise no exit point pseudo state
would be possible (the inner transition brings us to the exit point,
from where the containing state machine can take over).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="_images/conflict2.gif" alt="image"></span> MSM handles both cases itself, so the
designer needs only concentrate on its state machine and the UML
subtleties (not overlapping conditions), not on implementing this
behavior himself.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>state machine: the life cycle of a thing. It is made of states,
regions, transitions and processes incoming events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>state: a stage in the life cycle of a state machine. A state (like a
submachine) can have an entry and exit behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>event: an incident provoking (or not) a reaction of the state machine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transition: a specification of how a state machine reacts to an event.
It specifies a source state, the event triggering the transition, the
target state (which will become the newly active state if the transition
is triggered), guard and actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>action: an operation executed during the triggering of the transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>guard: a boolean operation being able to prevent the triggering of a
transition which would otherwise fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transition table: representation of a state machine. A state machine
diagram is a graphical, but incomplete representation of the same model.
A transition table, on the other hand, is a complete representation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>initial state: The state in which the state machine starts. Having
several orthogonal regions means having as many initial states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>submachine: A submachine is a state machine inserted as a state in
another state machine and can be found several times in a same state
machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>orthogonal regions: (logical) parallel flow of execution of a state
machine. Every region of a state machine gets a chance to process an
incoming event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>terminate pseudo-state: when this state becomes active, it terminates
the execution of the whole state machine. MSM does not destroy the state
machine as required by the UML standard, however, which lets you keep
all the state machine&#8217;s data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>entry/exit pseudo state: defined for submachines and are defined as a
connection between a transition outside of the submachine and a
transition inside the submachine. It is a way to enter or leave a
submachine through a predefined point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fork: a fork allows explicit entry into several orthogonal regions of
a submachine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>history: a history is a way to remember the active state of a
submachine so that the submachine can proceed in its last active state
next time it becomes active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>completion events (also called completion/anonymous transitions): when
a transition has no named event triggering it, it automatically fires
when the source state is active, unless a guard forbids it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transition conflict: a conflict is present if for a given source state
and incoming event, several transitions are possible. UML specifies that
guard conditions have to solve the conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal transitions: transition from a state to itself without having
exit and entry actions being called.</p>
