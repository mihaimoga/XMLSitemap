arrow_upward Defined in <boost/openmethod/macros.hpp>. BOOST_OPENMETHOD(ID, (PARAMETERS...), RETURN_TYPE [, REGISTRY]); Declares a method, called ID, with the given PARAMETERS and RETURN_TYPE, and adds it to REGISTRY. PARAMETERS is a comma-separated list of types, possibly followed by parameter names, just like in a function declaration. Parameters with a type in the form virtual_ptr<T> or virtual_<T> are called virtual parameters. The dynamic type of the arguments passed in virtual parameters determines which overrider to call, following the same rules as overloaded function resolution: Form the set of all applicable overriders. An overrider is applicable if it can be called with the arguments passed to the method. If the set is empty, call the error handler (if present in the registry), then terminate the program with abort. Remove the overriders that are dominated by other overriders in the set. Overrider A dominates overrider B if any of its virtual formal parameters is more specialized than B’s, and if none of B’s virtual parameters is more specialized than A’s. If the resulting set contains exactly one overrider, call it. If a single most specialized overrider does not exist, the program is terminated via abort. If the registry contains an error_handler policy, its error function is called with an object that describes the error, prior calling abort. error may prevent termination by throwing an exception. For each virtual argument arg, the dispatch mechanism calls virtual_traits::peek(arg) and deduces the v-table pointer from the result, using the first of the following methods that applies: If result is a virtual_ptr, get the pointer to the v-table from it. If boost_openmethod_vptr can be called with result and a Registry*, and it returns a vptr_type, call it. Call Registry::vptr::dynamic_vptr(result). The macro creates an ordinary inline function in the current scope, with the virtual_ decorators removed from the parameter types. virtual_ptrs are preserved. ID must be an identifier. Qualified names are not allowed. The default value for REGISTRY is the value of BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY at the point <boost/openmethod/core.hpp> is included. Changing the value of this symbol has no effect after that point. The macro creates several additional constructs: A struct forward declaration that acts as the method’s identifier: struct BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ID(ID); A class template declaration that acts as a container for the method’s overriders in the current scope: template<typename...> struct BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDERS(NAME); A guide function used to match overriders with the method: auto BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ID(ID)_guide(...) -> ::boost::openmethod::method< BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ID(ID)(PARAMETERS...), RETURN_TYPE [, REGISTRY]>; A registrar that adds the method to the registry.

When it is called, it forwards to an overrider selected from a set by examining the dynamic types of the virtual parameters. If this sounds like a virtual function, that’s because because an open-method with one virtual parameter is equivalent to a virtual function - with one big difference: it exists outside of classes. A virtual parameter is in the form virtual_ptr<Class>. It is a pointer-like class that points to an instance of Class. virtual_ptr is defined in the library’s main namespace, boost::openmethod. To create an open-method that implements the postfix operation, we use the BOOST_OPENMETHOD macro: BOOST_OPENMETHOD( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os), void); postfix is the method’s name. It takes one virtual parameter, node, and one non-virtual parameter, os. It returns void. The macro generates the following function: inline auto postfix(virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os) -> void { // examine the type of *node // select an overrider // call it } Before we can call the method, we need to define overriders. For that we use the BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE macro: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Variable> var, std::ostream& os), void) { os << var->v; } The overrider must have virtual parameters in the same positions as in the method. The classes in the method’s virtual parameters must be accessible, non-ambiguous bases of the classes in the overrider. Note that this rules out repeated inheritance. Apart from this restriction, multiple and virtual inheritance are supported. The non-virtual parameters must have exactly the same types as in the method. Let’s look at another overrider: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Plus> plus, std::ostream& os), void) { postfix(plus->left, os); os << ' '; postfix(plus->right, os); os << \" +\"; } This one calls postfix recursively to print the left and right sub-expressions. Note that we call the method just like an ordinary function. postfix expects a virtual_ptr<const Node>, and we are passing it a plain reference to a Node object. This works because virtual_ptr has conversion constructors from plain references or pointers to objects, or from other virtual_ptrs. There are two more things we need to do. OpenMethod is a library, not a compiler. It needs to be informed of all the classes that may be used as virtual parameters, and in method calls, and their inheritance relationships. We provide that information with the BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES macro: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Node, Variable, Plus, Times); Classes can be registered multiple times, in any order, and incrementally. Every direct base of a class must appear together with it in at least one call to BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES. This enables the library to deduce the complete inheritance lattice. The constructs used in this example require the classes to be polymorphic, in the standard C++ sense, i.e. they must have at least one virtual function. The library can also be used with non-polymorphic classes, with some restrictions. Finally, we need to call boost::openmethod::initialize() before the first call to an open-method. This builds the dispatch tables used during method calls. It is typically done once, at the very beginning of main, and requires the inclusion of <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp>. #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> int main() { boost::openmethod::initialize(); // ... } Putting it all together: struct Node { virtual ~Node() {} virtual int value() const = 0; }; struct Variable : Node { Variable(int value) : v(value) {} int value() const override { return v; } int v; }; struct Plus : Node { Plus(const Node& left, const Node& right) : left(left), right(right) {} int value() const override { return left.value() + right.value(); } const Node& left; const Node& right; }; struct Times : Node { Times(const Node& left, const Node& right) : left(left), right(right) {} int value() const override { return left.value() * right.value(); } const Node& left; const Node& right; }; // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ // library code // ============================================================================= // application code // vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> #include <iostream> using boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr; BOOST_OPENMETHOD(postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os), void); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Variable> var, std::ostream& os), void) { os << var->v; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Plus> plus, std::ostream& os), void) { postfix(plus->left, os); os << ' '; postfix(plus->right, os); os << \" +\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Times> times, std::ostream& os), void) { postfix(times->left, os); os << ' '; postfix(times->right, os); os << \" *\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Node, Variable, Plus, Times); int main() { boost::openmethod::initialize(); Variable a{2}, b{3}, c{4}; Plus d{a, b}; Times e{d, c}; postfix(e, std::cout); std::cout << \" = \" << e.value() << \"\\n\"; // 2 3 + 4 * = 20 } Edit this Page","title":"","component":"openmethod","version":"","name":"basics","url":"/openmethod/basics.html","titles":[]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"Advanced Features Core API arrow_back arrow_upward arrow_forward OpenMethod provides a macro-free interface: the core API. This is useful in certain situations, for example when combining open-methods and templates. Let’s rewrite the postfix method using the core API. An open-method is implemented as an instance of the method class template. Its parameters are an identifier type and a function type: #include <boost/openmethod/core.hpp> struct postfix_method_id; using postfix = method< postfix_method_id, void(virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os)>; The postfix_method_id class acts as the method’s identifier: it separates it from other methods with the same signature. For example, we could have another method, prefix, which writes expressions in prefix notation. It would have the same signature. Without the identifier argument, prefix and postfix would be the same method. The exact name of the identifier class does not matter. The class needs not be defined, only declared. Inventing identifier class names can get tedious, so OpenMethod provides a macro for that: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ID. Let’s use it: #include <boost/openmethod/macros.hpp> struct BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ID(postfix); using postfix = method< BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ID(postfix), void(virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os)>; We said macro-free interface, but here is a macro again! Well, we are not forced to use the macro. There is a benefit though: it is used in the implementation of high-level macros like BOOST_OPENMETHOD. This makes it possible to mix the two styles, for example to define a method using the macro, and add overriders using the core API. We call the method via the nested function object fn: postfix::fn(node, std::cout); Overriders are ordinary functions. We add them to the method via the class template override, nested in the method class. Its constructor adds the functions passed as template arguments to the method. auto postfix_variable(virtual_ptr<const Variable> node, std::ostream& os) { os << node->v; } static postfix::override<postfix_variable> override_postfix_variable; Once again we find ourselves inventing a name for a single use. In C++26, we will probably have the Python-like _ for this. We can also use a small macro: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_REGISTER. It takes a class, and instantiates a static object with an obfuscated name: #include <boost/openmethod/macros.hpp> auto postfix_plus(virtual_ptr<const Plus> node, std::ostream& os) { postfix::fn(node->left, os); os << ' '; postfix::fn(node->right, os); os << \" +\"; } auto postfix_times(virtual_ptr<const Times> node, std::ostream& os) { postfix::fn(node->left, os); os << ' '; postfix::fn(node->right, os); os << \" *\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_REGISTER(postfix::override<postfix_plus, postfix_times>); Again, use of this macro is completely optional. We register the classes with use_classes: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_REGISTER(use_classes<Node, Variable, Plus, Times>); Finally, we call the method via the static member of the method class fn: auto main() -> int { boost::openmethod::initialize(); Variable a{2}, b{3}, c{4}; Plus d{a, b}; Times e{d, c}; postfix::fn(e, std::cout); std::cout << \" = \" << e.value() << \"\\n\"; // 2 3 + 4 * = 20 } The primary purpose of the core API is to make open-methods inter-operate with templates. Plus and Times are obvious candidates for templatization. They only differ by the operation they perform, and we already have templates for that in the standard library: #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> struct Node { virtual ~Node() {} virtual int value() const = 0; }; struct Variable : Node { Variable(int value) : v(value) {} int value() const override { return v; } int v; }; template<typename Op> struct BinaryOp : Node { BinaryOp(const Node& left, const Node& right) : left(left), right(right) {} int value() const override { return Op()(left.value(), right.value()); } const Node& left; const Node& right; }; Let’s go back to defining postfix using BOOST_OPENMETHOD. It is more convenient, as it generates postfix as an ordinary inline function, which can be overloaded, passed around by address, etc. The overrider for Variable does not involve templates, so we can write it as before: BOOST_OPENMETHOD( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os), void); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Variable> var, std::ostream& os), void) { os << var->v; } We write a function template that renders binary operations in postfix notation: template<class BinaryOp, char Op> auto postfix_binary(virtual_ptr<const BinaryOp> node, std::ostream& os) { postfix(node->left, os); os << ' '; postfix(node->right, os); os << \" \" << Op; } Macro BOOST_OPENMETHOD_TYPE takes the same parameters as BOOST_OPENMETHOD, and expands to the core method instance. That is how we access its nested overrider class template: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_TYPE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os), void):: override< postfix_binary<BinaryOp<std::plus<int>>, '+'>, postfix_binary< BinaryOp<std::multiplies<int>>, '*'>> add_binary_overriders; We can register the classes with BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES, and write main like so: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES( Node, Variable, BinaryOp<std::plus<int>>, BinaryOp<std::multiplies<int>>); auto main() -> int { boost::openmethod::initialize(); Variable a{2}, b{3}, c{4}; BinaryOp<std::plus<int>> d{a, b}; BinaryOp<std::multiplies<int>> e{d, c}; postfix(e, std::cout); std::cout << \" = \" << e.value() << \"\\n\"; // 2 3 + 4 * = 20 } This example only scratches the surface of what can be done by combining templates, the core API, and libraries such as Boost.Mp11.

Stock registries use the std_rtti implementation of rtti. Here is its full source: struct std_rtti : rtti { template<class Registry> struct fn { template<class Class> static constexpr bool is_polymorphic = std::is_polymorphic_v<Class>; template<class Class> static auto static_type() -> type_id { return &typeid(Class); } template<class Class> static auto dynamic_type(const Class& obj) -> type_id { return &typeid(obj); } template<typename Stream> static auto type_name(type_id type, Stream& stream) -> void { stream << boost::core::demangle( reinterpret_cast<const std::type_info*>(type)->name()); } static auto type_index(type_id type) -> std::type_index { return std::type_index( *reinterpret_cast<const std::type_info*>(type)); } template<typename D, typename B> static auto dynamic_cast_ref(B&& obj) -> D { return dynamic_cast<D>(obj); } }; }; is_polymorphic is used to check if a class is polymorphic. This template is required. static_type is called during class registration, by virtual_ptrs \"final\" constructs. It is also called to set bad_call::method. This function is required. dynamic_type is used to read the dynamic type of a virtual argument. If only the virtual_ptr \"final\" constructs are used, or if boost_openmethod_vptr is provided for all the classes in the registry, this function can be omitted. type_name writes a representation of a type to a LightweightOutputStream. It is used to format error and trace messages. This function is optional; if it is not provided, type is rendered as \"type_id(type)\". type_index returns an object that uniquely identifies a class. Some forms of RTTI (most notably, C++'s typeid operator) do not guarantee that the type information object for a class is unique within the same program. This function is optional; if not provided, type is assumed to be unique, and used as is. dynamic_cast_ref casts an object to a class. It takes a reference, and returns a reference of the same category (and cv-qualifier if applicable) as B. This function is required only in presence of virtual inheritance. Let’s rewrite the Node example using several variations of custom RTTIs. In the first example, we use a \"static\" scheme, where the type ids are compile-time constants: struct Node { virtual ~Node() {} virtual int value() const = 0; // our custom RTTI: Node(unsigned type) : type(type) {} unsigned type; static constexpr unsigned static_type = 1; }; struct Variable : Node { static constexpr unsigned static_type = 2; Variable(int value) : Node(static_type), v(value) {} int value() const override { return v; } int v; }; struct Plus : Node { static constexpr unsigned static_type = 3; Plus(const Node& left, const Node& right) : Node(static_type), left(left), right(right) {} int value() const override { return left.value() + right.value(); } const Node& left; const Node& right; }; struct Times : Node { static constexpr unsigned static_type = 4; Times(const Node& left, const Node& right) : Node(static_type), left(left), right(right) {} int value() const override { return left.value() * right.value(); } const Node& left; const Node& right; }; Let’s define a rtti policy for this scheme. We are going to replace the default registry globally, so we do not include <boost/openmethod/core.hpp> or <boost/openmethod.hpp> - only what we need to implement the policy: #include <boost/openmethod/preamble.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/policies/vptr_vector.hpp> struct custom_rtti : boost::openmethod::policies::rtti { template<class Registry> struct fn : defaults { template<class T> static constexpr bool is_polymorphic = std::is_base_of_v<Node, T>; using type_id = boost::openmethod::type_id; // for brevity template<typename T> static auto static_type() { if constexpr (is_polymorphic<T>) { return reinterpret_cast<type_id>(T::static_type); } else { return reinterpret_cast<type_id>(0); } } template<typename T> static auto dynamic_type(const T& obj) { if constexpr (is_polymorphic<T>) { return reinterpret_cast<type_id>(obj.type); } else { return reinterpret_cast<type_id>(0); } } }; }; The policy’s notion of \"polymorphic\" is different from C++'s. Here, a class is \"polymorphic\" if it derives from Node, meaning that dynamic_type can extract the runtime type of a virtual argument. In fact, this policy does not require Node to be polymorphic in the C++ sense. If we remove the virtual destructor and implement value as an open-method as well, the program will still work. The policy is quite minimal. It does not support virtual inheritance, because it does not provide a dynamic_cast_ref function. It would not produce good error or trace messages, because it does not provide a type_name function. Instead, it relies on the type_name inherited from rtti::defaults. It renders types as adorned integers, e.g. \"type_id(2)\". All non-\"polymorphic\" types would be rendered the same way, as \"type_id(0)\". rtti::defaults also provides a default implementation for type_index, which simply returns its argument. Now we need a policy to get a v-table pointer from an object. Our RTTI system has an interesting property: its type ids are monotonically allocated in a small, dense range. It means that we can use them as indexes in a vector. vptr_vector is perfect for that. So here is our registry: struct custom_registry : boost::openmethod::registry< custom_rtti, boost::openmethod::policies::vptr_vector> {}; #define BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY custom_registry Defining macro BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY sets the default registry used by all library components that need one. Next, we include the main header. Because BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY is defined, its value is used for the default registry. The rest of the example is unchanged. In the previous example, the RTTI system assigns type ids statically. Another popular approach is to allocate type ids using a global counter, manipulated by static constructors. Like so: struct Node { Node(unsigned type) : type(type) {} unsigned type; static unsigned last_type; static unsigned static_type; }; struct Variable : Node { static unsigned static_type; Variable(int value) : Node(static_type), v(value) {} int v; }; struct Plus : Node { static unsigned static_type; Plus(const Node& left, const Node& right) : Node(static_type), left(left), right(right) {} const Node& left; const Node& right; }; struct Times : Node { static unsigned static_type; Times(const Node& left, const Node& right) : Node(static_type), left(left), right(right) {} const Node& left; const Node& right; }; The type ids are assigned in another translation unit: unsigned Node::last_type = 0; unsigned Node::static_type = ++Node::last_type; unsigned Variable::static_type = ++Node::last_type; unsigned Plus::static_type = ++Node::last_type; unsigned Times::static_type = ++Node::last_type; This is a problem, because static_type is called by BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES, also during static construction. There no guarantee regarding the order of execution of static constructors across several translation units. BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES risks reading the type ids before they have been assigned. The solution is to derive the rtti policy from deferred_static_rtti. Doing so postpones reading the type ids until initialize is called: #include <boost/openmethod/preamble.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/policies/vptr_vector.hpp> // note: vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv struct custom_rtti : boost::openmethod::policies::deferred_static_rtti { template<class Registry> struct fn : defaults { template<class T> static constexpr bool is_polymorphic = std::is_base_of_v<Node, T>; using type_id = boost::openmethod::type_id; // for brevity template<typename T> static auto static_type() { if constexpr (is_polymorphic<T>) { return reinterpret_cast<type_id>(T::static_type); } else { return reinterpret_cast<type_id>(0); } } template<typename T> static auto dynamic_type(const T& obj) { if constexpr (is_polymorphic<T>) { return reinterpret_cast<type_id>(obj.type); } else { return reinterpret_cast<type_id>(0); } } }; }; Edit this Page","title":"","component":"openmethod","version":"","name":"custom_rtti","url":"/openmethod/custom_rtti.html","titles":[{"text":"Deferred RTTI","hash":"_deferred_rtti","id":1}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"Advanced Features Error Handling arrow_back arrow_upward arrow_forward Errors can occur during initialize, or during method dispatch, if the method’s registry contains the runtime_checks policy.

Let’s consider yet another variation of the pay example. This time, we want to update a balance variable in a Payroll class, when an employee is paid. Thus we pass the payroll object to the pay method: BOOST_OPENMETHOD( pay, (Payroll & payroll, boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double); BOOST_OPENMETHOD declares an overrider container for pay in the current namespace, even though it does not define any overrider by itself. We can thus name the individual address containers in friend declarations. But note that at this point, the containers have not been specialized yet! In particular, the fn member function does not exist yet. Instead, we declare friendship to the container itself: class Payroll { public: double balance() const { return balance_; } private: double balance_ = 1'000'000.0; void update_balance(double amount) { // throw if balance would become negative balance_ += amount; } friend BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDER( pay, (Payroll & payroll, boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double); friend BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDER( pay, (Payroll & payroll, boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Salesman>), double); }; We can now implement the pay overriders: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( pay, (Payroll & payroll, boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double) { double pay = 5000.0; payroll.update_balance(-pay); return pay; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( pay, (Payroll & payroll, boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Salesman> emp), double) { double base = next(payroll, emp); double commission = emp->sales * 0.05; payroll.update_balance(-commission); return base + commission; } // ...and let's not forget to register the classes BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Employee, Salesman) We can also declare friendship en masse: class Payroll { public: double balance() const { return balance_; } private: double balance_ = 1'000'000.0; void update_balance(double amount) { // throw if balance would become negative balance_ += amount; } template<typename...> friend struct BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDERS(pay); }; Note, however, that this makes all the overriders of any pay method, with any signature, in the current namespace, friends of Payroll.

Let’s use a payroll application as an example. We have two roles: Employee and Salesman, and a pay method that computes the monthly pay of an employee. We want to override and call pay from multiple translation units, so we put it in a header: // roles.hpp #ifndef ROLES_HPP #define ROLES_HPP #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> struct Employee { virtual ~Employee() = default; }; struct Salesman : Employee { double sales = 0.0; }; BOOST_OPENMETHOD(pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double); #endif // ROLES_HPP BOOST_OPENMETHOD defines an inline function, so it can be called only once in a translation unit. The include guards see to this. Let’s write the override for \"just\" employees - they get a fixed salary. BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE adds an overrider to the method. We don’t want to add the same multiple times; that would create an ambiguity. Thus it should go in an implementation file: // employee.cpp #include \"roles.hpp\" #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double) { return 5000.0; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Employee) Salesmen get a salary like employees, and on top get a commission on their sales. The next function, available only in the body of an overrider, calls the next most specialized overrider. It is similar to super in other languages, except that it does not stand for an object, but for an overrider. // salesman.cpp #include \"roles.hpp\" #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Salesman> emp), double) { return next(emp) + emp->sales * 0.05; // base + commission } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Employee, Salesman) Paytime! // main.cpp #include \"roles.hpp\" #include <iostream> #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> int main() { boost::openmethod::initialize(); Employee bill; Salesman bob; bob.sales = 100'000.0; std::cout << \"pay bill: $\" << pay(bill) << \"\\n\"; // pay bill: $5000 std::cout << \"pay bob: $\" << pay(bob) << \"\\n\"; // pay bob: $10000 } In the previous example, we used next to call the super-overrider. We can also call an overrider directly. To do this, we can declare the overrider in the header, and define it in an implementation file: // roles.hpp #ifndef ROLES_HPP #define ROLES_HPP #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> struct Employee { virtual ~Employee() = default; }; struct Salesman : Employee { double sales = 0.0; }; BOOST_OPENMETHOD(pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DECLARE_OVERRIDER( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double); #endif // ROLES_HPP Unlike function declarations, BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DECLARE_OVERRIDER cannot appear multiple times in a translation unit with the same arguments. Also, it requires the method itself to be defined prior using this macro. Overriders are placed in overrider containers. An overrider container is a class template named after the method, declared in the current namespace. It is specialized for each overrider signature. Macro BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDER takes the same arguments BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE, and expands to the corresponding specialization of the overrider container. Containers have a static member function fn that contains the body the overrider, provided by the user. We can call the overrider for Employee like so: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Salesman> emp), double) { return BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDER( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee> emp), double)::fn(emp) + emp->sales * 0.05; // base + commission } This is similar to a virtual function calling a base overrider. Virtual functions don’t have the equivalent of Smalltalk’s or Python’s super, but OpenMethod does, it’s next. It is almost always the right choice. The exception is: when performance is critical, we may want to inline the call to the base overrider. BOOST_OPENMETHOD_INLINE_OVERRIDE defines the overrider as an inline function, and it can go in a header file: // roles.hpp #ifndef ROLES_HPP #define ROLES_HPP #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> struct Employee { virtual ~Employee() = default; }; struct Salesman : Employee { double sales = 0.0; }; BOOST_OPENMETHOD(pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_INLINE_OVERRIDE( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double) { return 5000.0; } #endif // ROLES_HPP With inlining the overrider for Salesman compiles to (clang-20, x64-linux): movsd xmm0, qword ptr [rsi + 8] mulsd xmm0, qword ptr [rip + .LCPI1_0] addsd xmm0, qword ptr [rip + .LCPI1_1] ret Edit this Page","title":"","component":"openmethod","version":"","name":"headers","url":"/openmethod/headers.html","titles":[]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"Boost.OpenMethod arrow_upward arrow_forward Boost.OpenMethod implements open-(multi-)methods in C++17 and above.

How do we do it? The simple way is: add a new virtual function. Like so: #include <iostream> struct Node { // as before virtual void postfix(std::ostream& os) const = 0; }; struct Variable : Node { // as before virtual void postfix(std::ostream& os) const override { os << v; } }; struct Plus : Node { // as before void postfix(std::ostream& os) const override { left.postfix(os); os << ' '; right.postfix(os); os << \" +\"; } }; struct Times : Node { // as before void postfix(std::ostream& os) const override { left.postfix(os); os << ' '; right.postfix(os); os << \" *\"; } }; int main() { Variable a{2}, b{3}, c{4}; Plus d{a, b}; Times e{d, c}; e.postfix(std::cout); // 2 3 + 4 * std::cout << \" = \" << e.value() << \"\\n\"; // = 20 } If the classes are part of a small, self-contained program, this may be a reasonable solution. Otherwise, there are serious problems with this approach. We need to modify all the classes in the hierarchy, which, in a real program, may be numerous and spread across multiple files. This assumes that we have access to their source code. We need to recompile all the files that use the Node classes, because the layout of their virtual function tables (v-tables) has changed. Programs that use the Node classes get the overriders of postfix, even those that don’t call postfix anywhere. They also pull in postfix's transitive dependencies, in this case std::ostream, locales, facets, exceptions, etc. Note that now we need to include <iostream> before defining the classes. In C++, this problem is often \"solved\" with the Visitor design pattern. We may still need to modify Node to equip it with Visitor support, if it is not there already. But once that is done, we can add all the operations we want, albeit in a clumsy fashion. Sadly, it is now difficult to add new Node classes, because we have to modify the Visitor’s interface, and all its implementations, and recompile all the files that use the Visitor. We traded one problem for another. Paul Graham said that design patterns are essentially workarounds for features that are missing in less expressive languages. Indeed, in some languages, our problem does not even exist. C# has extension classes. Lisp, Clojure, Dylan, Julia, Cecil, TADS, and others, have multi-methods. But wait! What do multi-methods have to do with our problem? There is no multiple dispatch going on here! The thing is, \"multi-methods\" is not a very good name. Even in languages that support them, many \"multi-methods\" have a single virtual parameter - they are uni-methods [1]! For that reason, we prefer the term \"open-methods\", to emphasize the important feature: openness. Multiple dispatch is just a bonus. An open-method is like a virtual function, but it exists outside of a class, as a free-standing function. We can create all the open-methods we need, without ever needing to modify existing classes. This library implements open-methods for C++17 and above. Next we will see how to use them in the Node example. 1. Multiple dispatch in practice, Radu Muschevici, 2008.

This is often called \"multi-method\" or \"multiple dispatch\". All the virtual parameters participate equally in overrider selection, following the same rules as those governing overload resolution - except that the selection happens at runtime, and takes into account the arguments dynamic types. Multiple dispatch is occasionally useful. When it is needed, it can be difficult to implement correctly and efficiently by hand. For example, given the following classes: struct Role { virtual ~Role() = default; }; struct Employee : Role {}; struct Salesman : Employee {}; struct Manager : Employee {}; struct Founder : Role {}; struct Expense { virtual ~Expense() { } }; struct Public : Expense {}; struct Bus : Public {}; struct Metro : Public {}; struct Taxi : Expense {}; struct PrivateJet : Expense {}; We want to implement a function - approve - that determines who can make what kind of expenses. The rules are: By default, an expense is rejected. Employees can take any public transportation. Managers can also take a taxi, for a ride cost up to $100. Founders can take any transportation, including a private jet. This is a case of multiple dispatch: the outcome depends on two parameters. It can be implemented as a method with two virtual arguments. The four rules can be expressed as four overriders: using boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr; BOOST_OPENMETHOD( approve, (virtual_ptr<const Role>, virtual_ptr<const Expense>, double), bool); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( approve, (virtual_ptr<const Role>, virtual_ptr<const Expense>, double), bool) { return false; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( approve, (virtual_ptr<const Employee>, virtual_ptr<const Public>, double), bool) { return true; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( approve, (virtual_ptr<const Manager>, virtual_ptr<const Taxi>, double amount), bool) { return amount < 100.0; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( approve, (virtual_ptr<const Founder>, virtual_ptr<const Expense>, double), bool) { return true; } int main() { boost::openmethod::initialize(); Founder bill; Employee bob; Manager alice; Bus bus; Taxi taxi; PrivateJet jet; std::cout << std::boolalpha; std::cout << approve(bill, bus, 4.0) << \"\\n\"; // true std::cout << approve(bob, bus, 4.0) << \"\\n\"; // true std::cout << approve(bob, taxi, 36.0) << \"\\n\"; // false std::cout << approve(alice, taxi, 36.0) << \"\\n\"; // true std::cout << approve(alice, taxi, 2000.0) << \"\\n\"; // false std::cout << approve(bill, jet, 120'000.0) << \"\\n\"; // true std::cout << approve(bob, jet, 120'000.0) << \"\\n\"; // false std::cout << approve(alice, jet, 120'000.0) << \"\\n\"; // false } Because approve understands inheritance, we don’t have to specify an overrider for every combination (5 role classes x 6 expense classes = 30 combinations). Just like with overload resolution, ambiguities can arise. Let’s look at another example - matrix addition: #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> #include <iostream> struct Matrix { virtual ~Matrix() = default; }; struct DenseMatrix : Matrix {}; struct SparseMatrix : Matrix {}; BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Matrix, DenseMatrix, SparseMatrix); using boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr; BOOST_OPENMETHOD( add, (virtual_ptr<const Matrix>, virtual_ptr<const Matrix>), void); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( add, (virtual_ptr<const Matrix>, virtual_ptr<const SparseMatrix>), void) { } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( add, (virtual_ptr<const SparseMatrix>, virtual_ptr<const Matrix>), void) { } int main() { boost::openmethod::initialize(); SparseMatrix a, b; add(a, b); } The programs terminates with the following error message: ambiguous Aborted (core dumped) This is because the call to add(a, b) is ambiguous: both overriders are equally good matches.

BOOST_OPENMETHOD defines a method in the current namespace. BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE works across namespaces. Overriders are not required to be in the same namespace as the method they override. The macro adds the overrider to a method that can be called with the same arguments as the overrider, possibly located via argument dependant lookup. Overrider containers are added to the current namespace. It follows that the same method can have overriders in multiple containers, in different namespaces. This must be taken into account when calling an overrider explicitly. Let’s put Employee and Salesman in their own namespaces: // roles.hpp #ifndef ROLES_HPP #define ROLES_HPP #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> namespace employees { struct Employee { virtual ~Employee() = default; }; BOOST_OPENMETHOD(pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_INLINE_OVERRIDE( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee>), double) { return 5000.0; } } namespace sales { struct Salesman : employees::Employee { double sales = 0.0; }; } // namespace sales #endif // ROLES_HPP When we try to compile salesman.cpp: BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Salesman> emp), double) { return BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDER( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Employee> emp), double)::fn(emp) + emp->sales * 0.05; // base + commission } We get an error like: error: implicit instantiation of undefined template 'sales::pay_boost_openmethod_overriders< double (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const employees::Employee>)> This is because the overrider container for pay in namespace sales is specialized for Salesman, but not for Employee. The overrider for Employee is in a specialization of a different container, in namespace employees. The solution is to qualify the overrider container with the employees namespace: namespace sales { BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const Salesman> emp), double) { return employees::BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDER( pay, (boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<const employees::Employee> emp), double)::fn(emp) + emp->sales * 0.05; // base + commission } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(employees::Employee, Salesman) } // namespace sales Edit this Page","title":"","component":"openmethod","version":"","name":"namespaces","url":"/openmethod/namespaces.html","titles":[]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"Basic Features Performance arrow_back arrow_upward arrow_forward Open-methods can be as fast as ordinary virtual member functions when compiled with optimization. First, let’s examine the code generated by clang for an ordinary virtual function call: void call_virtual_function(const Node& node, std::ostream& os) { node.postfix(os); } Clang compiles this function to the following assembly on the x64 architecture: mov rax, qword ptr [rdi] mov rax, qword ptr [rax + 24] jmp rax # TAILCALL llvm-mca estimates this code has a throughput of 1 cycle per dispatch. Let’s look at a method call now: void call_via_ref(const Node& node, std::ostream& os) { postfix(node, os); } This compiles to (variable names are shortened for readability): mov rax, rdi mov rcx, qword ptr [rdi] mov rdi, qword ptr [rip + mult] imul rdi, qword ptr [rcx - 8] movzx ecx, byte ptr [rip + shift] shr rdi, cl mov rdx, rsi mov rcx, qword ptr [rip + vptr_vector_vptrs] mov rdi, qword ptr [rcx + 8*rdi] mov rcx, qword ptr [rip + postfix::fn+88] mov rcx, qword ptr [rdi + 8*rcx] mov rsi, rax jmp rcx # TAILCALL This is quite a few instructions more. Upon closer examination, we see that many are memory reads, independent of one another; they can thus be executed in parallel. For example, the first three instructions can execute simultaneously. llvm-mca estimates a throughput of 4 cycles per dispatch. However, the difference is amortized by the time spent passing the arguments and returning from the function; plus, of course, executing the body of the function. Micro- and RDTSC-based benchmarks suggest that dispatching an open-methods with a single virtual argument via a reference is between 30% and 50% slower than calling the equivalent virtual function, with an empty body and no other arguments. In most real programs, the overhead would be unnoticeable. However, call_via_ref does two things: it constructs a virtual_ptr<Node> from a const Node&, then it calls the method. The construction of the virtual_ptr is the costly part. It performs a lookup in a perfect hash table, indexed by pointers to std::type_info, to find the correct vtable. Then it stores a pointer to it in the virtual_ptr object, along with a pointer to the object.[1] If we already have a virtual_ptr: void call_via_virtual_ptr(virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os) { postfix(node, os); } A method call compiles to: mov rax, qword ptr [rip + postfix::fn+88] mov rax, qword ptr [rdi + 8*rax] jmp rax # TAILCALL virtual_ptr arguments are passed through the method call, to the overrider, which can use them to make further method calls. Code that incorporates open-methods in its design should use virtual_ptrs in place of plain pointers or references, as much as possible. Here is the Node example, rewritten to use virtual_ptrs thoughout: #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> using boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr; struct Node { virtual ~Node() {} virtual int value() const = 0; }; struct Variable : Node { Variable(int value) : v(value) {} int value() const override { return v; } int v; }; struct Plus : Node { Plus(virtual_ptr<const Node> left, virtual_ptr<const Node> right) : left(left), right(right) {} int value() const override { return left->value() + right->value(); } virtual_ptr<const Node> left, right; }; struct Times : Node { Times(virtual_ptr<const Node> left, virtual_ptr<const Node> right) : left(left), right(right) {} int value() const override { return left->value() * right->value(); } virtual_ptr<const Node> left, right; }; #include <iostream> using boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr; BOOST_OPENMETHOD(postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os), void); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Variable> var, std::ostream& os), void) { os << var->v; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Plus> plus, std::ostream& os), void) { postfix(plus->left, os); os << ' '; postfix(plus->right, os); os << \" +\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Times> times, std::ostream& os), void) { postfix(times->left, os); os << ' '; postfix(times->right, os); os << \" *\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Node, Variable, Plus, Times); #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> int main() { boost::openmethod::initialize(); Variable a{2}, b{3}, c{4}; Plus d{a, b}; Times e{d, c}; postfix(e, std::cout); std::cout << \" = \" << e.value() << \"\\n\"; // 2 3 + 4 * = 20 } 1.

A method can only reference classes in the same registry. If a class is used as a virtual parameter in methods using different registries, it must be registered with each of them. Class templates use_classes, method, virtual_ptr, and macros BOOST_OPENMETHOD and BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES, take an additional argument, a registry class, which defaults to default_registry. The default registry can be overriden by defining the macroprocessor symbol BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY before including <boost/openmethod/core.hpp>. The value of the symbol is used as a default template parameter for use_classes, method, virtual_ptr, and others. Once the core header has been included, changing BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY has no effect. A registry has a collection of policies. Each policy belongs to a policy category. A registry may contain at most one policy of each category. Policies control how type information is obtained, how vptrs are acquired, how errors are handled and reported, etc. While the behavior of initialize can be customized via options, policies are primarily involved in method dispatch. Policies are placed in the boost::openmethod::policies namespace. default_registry contains the following policies: policy category policy role rtti std_rtti provides type information for classes and objects vptr vptr_vector stores vptrs in an indexed collection type_hash fast_perfect_hash hashes type id to an index in a vector error_handler default_error_handler calls an overridable handler function output stderr_output prints diagnostics to stderr if BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ENABLE_RUNTIME_CHECKS is defined, default_registry also contains the runtime_checks policy. This enables extra validations during method dispatch, which can detect missing class registrations that could not be caught by initialize. The library provides another predefined registry: indirect_registry. It is useful when shared libraries are dynamically loaded at runtime, and add methods and overriders across program and shared library boundaries. See the section about shared libraries. Registries can be created from scratch, using the registry template. Here is the definition of default_registry, copied from <boost/openmethod/registry.hpp>: struct default_registry : registry< policies::std_rtti, policies::vptr_vector, policies::fast_perfect_hash, policies::default_error_handler, policies::stderr_output #ifdef BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ENABLE_RUNTIME_CHECKS , policies::runtime_checks #endif > { }; When defining a new registry, it is recommended to define a new class, derived from registry<…​>, rather than via a typedef, which would create excessively long symbol names and make debugging harder. A registry can calso be created by copying an existing registry’s policies, using the with and without nested templates. For example, indirect_registry is a tweak of default_registry: struct indirect_registry : default_registry::with<policies::indirect_vptr> {}; Policies are implemented as unary Boost.MP11 quoted metafunctions. A policy is an ordinary class that contains a nested class template fn, which is instantiated by the registry, passing itself as the single template argument. The reason for this mechanism is to allow policies to have static data members, which each registry must have its own set of. vptr_vector, for example, stores v-table pointers in a std::vector. If it is used in two different registries, it needs to use two different vectors, one for each registry.

Statically linking to a shared library behaves the same way as linking to a static library on all platforms. Objects from the program and the shared libraries can contribute classes, methods and overriders to the default registry, or any registries. By \"dynamic linking\", we mean a program loading a shared library after it has started, and accessing its content. A common application of dynamic linking is to implement plugin architectures. OpenMethod uses global data to keep track of methods, overriders and classes, all managed by static constructors and destructors. initialize uses that information to set up dispatch tables. These variables must be truly global and unique for the library to operate correctly. Under this condition, a shared library can dynamically add classes, methods and overriders to an existing registry. initialize must be called to rebuild the dispatch tables after loading or unloading a shared library. Dynamic linking on Linux and POSIX-like platforms fulfills the unicity requirement with little effort from the programmer. On Linux, it is just a matter of tossing in -rdynamic, or adding ENABLE_EXPORTS ON to the library’s target properties if using cmake. If a library only uses its own registries, for example, if using open-methods as an implementation detail, it has its own global data, and there is no need to call initialize. Let’s look at an example. The following header is included by the program and the shared library: // animals.hpp #include <string> #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> struct Animal { virtual ~Animal() {} }; struct Herbivore : Animal {}; struct Carnivore : Animal {}; BOOST_OPENMETHOD( meet, ( boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<Animal>, boost::openmethod::virtual_ptr<Animal>), std::string); The shared library contains an object that adds two overriders, a new class, Tiger, and a factory function: // extensions.cpp #include \"animals.hpp\" using namespace boost::openmethod::aliases; BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( meet, (virtual_ptr<Herbivore>, virtual_ptr<Carnivore>), std::string) { return \"run\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( meet, (virtual_ptr<Carnivore>, virtual_ptr<Herbivore>), std::string) { return \"hunt\"; } struct Tiger : Carnivore {}; BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Tiger, Carnivore); extern \"C\" { #ifdef _WIN32 __declspec(dllexport) #endif auto make_tiger() -> Animal* { return new Tiger; } } The main program adds a couple of classes then calls meet method. At this point, we only have the catch-call overrider: // dynamic_main.cpp #include \"animals.hpp\" #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> #include <boost/dll/shared_library.hpp> #include <boost/dll/runtime_symbol_info.hpp> #include <iostream> #include <memory> using namespace boost::openmethod::aliases; struct Cow : Herbivore {}; struct Wolf : Carnivore {}; BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Animal, Herbivore, Cow, Wolf, Carnivore); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( meet, (virtual_ptr<Animal>, virtual_ptr<Animal>), std::string) { return \"greet\"; } int main() { std::cout << \"Before loading the shared library.\\n\"; boost::openmethod::initialize(); std::cout << \"cow meets wolf -> \" << meet(*std::make_unique<Cow>(), *std::make_unique<Wolf>()) << \"\\n\"; // greet std::cout << \"wolf meets cow -> \" << meet(*std::make_unique<Wolf>(), *std::make_unique<Cow>()) << \"\\n\"; // greet // to be continued... return 0; } We load the shared library using Boost.DLL. After calling initialize, the new overriders are installed. The main program can also use Tiger objects, even though it has no knowledge of that class at compile time. int main() { // ... std::cout << \"\\nAfter loading the shared library.\\n\"; boost::dll::shared_library lib( boost::dll::program_location().parent_path() / LIBRARY_NAME, boost::dll::load_mode::rtld_now); boost::openmethod::initialize(); std::cout << \"cow meets wolf -> \" << meet(*std::make_unique<Cow>(), *std::make_unique<Wolf>()) << \"\\n\"; // run std::cout << \"wolf meets cow -> \" << meet(*std::make_unique<Wolf>(), *std::make_unique<Cow>()) << \"\\n\"; // hunt auto make_tiger = lib.get<Animal*()>(\"make_tiger\"); std::cout << \"cow meets tiger -> \" << meet( *std::make_unique<Cow>(), *std::unique_ptr<Animal>(make_tiger())) << \"\\n\"; // hunt return 0; } Finally, we unload the shared library and call initialize again. The overriders provided by the shared library are removed from the method. // ... std::cout << \"\\nAfter unloading the shared library.\\n\"; lib.unload(); boost::openmethod::initialize(); std::cout << \"cow meets wolf -> \" << meet(*std::make_unique<Cow>(), *std::make_unique<Wolf>()) << \"\\n\"; // greet std::cout << \"wolf meets cow -> \" << meet(*std::make_unique<Wolf>(), *std::make_unique<Cow>()) << \"\\n\"; // greet return 0; } If we try the example on Windows, the result is disappointing: Before loading the shared library. cow meets wolf -> greet wolf meets cow -> greet After loading the shared library. cow meets wolf -> greet wolf meets cow -> greet cow meets tiger -> unknown class struct Tiger What happens here is that the program and the DLL have their own copies of \"global\" variables. When the DLL is loaded, its static constructors run, and they add overriders to their copy of the method (the method::fn static variable for the given name and signature). They are ignored when the main program calls initialize. Likewise, BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Tiger, Carnivore) in the DLL adds Tiger to the DLL’s copy of the registry. For the perspective of the program’s registry, the class does not exist. In theory, this can be fixed by adding declspec(dllimport) and declspec(dllexport) attributes where needed. However, this is not practical, because programs and DLLs can both import and export registries and methods. The underlying objects are instantiated from templates, which complicates the matter. Research is being done on this subject. However, as of now, dynamic loading is supported on Windows only if it does not attempt to share a registry across modules. initialize rebuilds the v-tables in the registry. This invalidates all the virtual_ptrs, and also the v-table pointers stored in objects by inplace_vptr_base, related to that registry. This is seldom an issue, as most programs that dynamically load shared libraries do so at the very beginning of their execution. Otherwise, indirect v-table pointers must be used. This is achieved by using a registry that contains the indirect_vptr policy. <boost/openmethod/default_registry.hpp> provides an indirect_registry that has the same policies as default_registry, plus indirect_vptr. We can use it to override the default registry, for example using a compiler command-line switch (-DBOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY=indirect_registry). Here is an example of a program that carries virtual_ptrs across initialize calls: // indirect_main.cpp #include \"animals.hpp\" #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/interop/std_unique_ptr.hpp> #include <boost/dll/shared_library.hpp> #include <boost/dll/runtime_symbol_info.hpp> #include <iostream> using namespace boost::openmethod::aliases; struct Cow : Herbivore {}; struct Wolf : Carnivore {}; BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Animal, Herbivore, Cow, Wolf, Carnivore); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( meet, (virtual_ptr<Animal>, virtual_ptr<Animal>), std::string) { return \"greet\"; } auto main() -> int { using namespace boost::openmethod::aliases; std::cout << \"Before loading the shared library.\\n\"; boost::openmethod::initialize(); auto gracie = make_unique_virtual<Cow>(); auto willy = make_unique_virtual<Wolf>(); std::cout << \"cow meets wolf -> \" << meet(*gracie, *willy) << \"\\n\"; // greet std::cout << \"wolf meets cow -> \" << meet(*willy, *gracie) << \"\\n\"; // greet std::cout << \"cow.vptr() = \" << gracie.vptr() << \"\\n\"; // 0x5d3121d22be8 std::cout << \"wolf.vptr() = \" << willy.vptr() << \"\\n\"; // 0x5d3121d22bd8 std::cout << \"\\nAfter loading the shared library.\\n\"; boost::dll::shared_library lib( boost::dll::program_location().parent_path() / LIBRARY_NAME, boost::dll::load_mode::rtld_now); boost::openmethod::initialize(); std::cout << \"cow meets wolf -> \" << meet(*gracie, *willy) << \"\\n\"; // run std::cout << \"wolf meets cow -> \" << meet(*willy, *gracie) << \"\\n\"; // hunt std::cout << \"cow.vptr() = \" << gracie.vptr() << \"\\n\"; // 0x5d3121d21998 std::cout << \"wolf.vptr() = \" << willy.vptr() << \"\\n\"; // 0x5d3121d21988 return 0; } This program loads a shared library that is itself compiled with -DBOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY=indirect_registry.

However, we may also want to use smart pointers for lifetime management; think of std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, or boost::intrusive_ptr. Does it mean that we have to choose between the performance of virtual_ptr and the convenience of std::unique_ptr? Or carry around both types of smart pointers? Fortunately, no. virtual_ptr can inter-operate with smart pointers. If virtual_ptr recognizes that its template argument is a smart pointer class, it uses that smart pointer to track the underlying object, instead of a plain pointer. virtual_ptr<const Node> and virtual_ptr<std::unique_ptr<const Node>> both point to a const Node; the former uses a plain const Node* while the latter uses a std::unique_ptr<const Node>. Both carry the same v-table pointer. Smart virtual_ptrs automatically convert to their non-smart, \"plain\" counterparts - e.g. from virtual_ptr<std::unique_ptr<const Node>> to virtual_ptr<const Node>. Methods and overriders typically use plain virtual_ptrs, although it is not always the case [1]. The reverse conversion, from plain to smart, does not exist, because it would have the potential to accidentally create smart pointers. Likewise, a smart virtual_ptr can be constructed from a smart pointer, but not directly from a plain reference or pointer. The library provides aliases for standard smart pointers: unique_virtual_ptr<Class> is an alias for virtual_ptr<std::unique_ptr<Class>> shared_virtual_ptr<Class> is an alias for virtual_ptr<std::shared_ptr<Class>> The standard library provides std::make_unique and std::make_shared to create smart pointers. They are convenient, robust in presence of exceptions, and, in the case of std::shared_ptr, more efficient. OpenMethod provides these counterparts: make_unique_virtual_ptr<Class>(…​) make_shared_virtual_ptr<Class>(…​) Since these functions create the object, they know its exact type with certainty. Thus they don’t need to perform a hash table lookup to find the appropriate v-table; they simply read it from a static variable. As a consequence, they don’t require Class to be polymorphic. The aliases and the make_* functions are aliased in namespace boost::openmethod::aliases, making it convenient to import constructs that are likely to be used together. Smart virtual_ptrs are implemented in their own headers, found in the interop subdirectory. For example, support for std::unique_ptr is provided in <boost/openmethod/interop/std_unique_ptr.hpp>. <boost/openmethod.hpp> does not include smart pointer headers, so they must be included explicitly. Here is a variation of the AST example that uses dynamic allocation and unique pointers: #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/interop/std_unique_ptr.hpp> using namespace boost::openmethod::aliases; struct Node { virtual ~Node() {} virtual int value() const = 0; }; struct Variable : Node { Variable(int value) : v(value) {} int value() const override { return v; } int v; }; struct Plus : Node { Plus(unique_virtual_ptr<const Node> left, unique_virtual_ptr<const Node> right) : left(std::move(left)), right(std::move(right)) {} int value() const override { return left->value() + right->value(); } unique_virtual_ptr<const Node> left, right; }; struct Times : Node { Times(unique_virtual_ptr<const Node> left, unique_virtual_ptr<const Node> right) : left(std::move(left)), right(std::move(right)) {} int value() const override { return left->value() * right->value(); } unique_virtual_ptr<const Node> left, right; }; #include <iostream> BOOST_OPENMETHOD(postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os), void); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Variable> var, std::ostream& os), void) { os << var->v; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Plus> plus, std::ostream& os), void) { postfix(plus->left, os); os << ' '; postfix(plus->right, os); os << \" +\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (virtual_ptr<const Times> times, std::ostream& os), void) { postfix(times->left, os); os << ' '; postfix(times->right, os); os << \" *\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Node, Variable, Plus, Times); #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> int main() { boost::openmethod::initialize(); auto a = std::make_unique<Variable>(2); auto b = std::make_unique<Variable>(3); auto c = std::make_unique<Variable>(4); auto d = make_unique_virtual<Plus>(std::move(a), std::move(b)); auto e = make_unique_virtual<Times>(std::move(d), std::move(c)); postfix(e, std::cout); std::cout << \" = \" << e->value() << \"\\n\"; // 2 3 + 4 * = 20 } 1. For example, consider a transpose method for matrices. If the matrix is symmetric, the overrider should return its argument. This can be implemented by passing a virtual_ptr<std::shared_ptr<const Matrix>> to the method.

In a method declaration, parameters with a type wrappted in class template virtual_ are considered in overrider selection (along with virtual_ptr parameters). For example, the Node example can be rewritten as follows: struct Node { virtual int value() const = 0; }; struct Variable : Node { Variable(int value) : v(value) {} int value() const override { return v; } int v; }; struct Plus : Node { Plus(const Node& left, const Node& right) : left(left), right(right) {} int value() const override { return left.value() + right.value(); } const Node& left; const Node& right; }; struct Times : Node { Times(const Node& left, const Node& right) : left(left), right(right) {} int value() const override { return left.value() * right.value(); } const Node& left; const Node& right; }; #include <boost/openmethod.hpp> #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> using boost::openmethod::virtual_; BOOST_OPENMETHOD(postfix, (virtual_<const Node&> node, std::ostream& os), void); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (const Variable& var, std::ostream& os), void) { os << var.v; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (const Plus& plus, std::ostream& os), void) { postfix(plus.left, os); os << ' '; postfix(plus.right, os); os << \" +\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE( postfix, (const Times& times, std::ostream& os), void) { postfix(times.left, os); os << ' '; postfix(times.right, os); os << \" *\"; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Node, Variable, Plus, Times); auto main() -> int { boost::openmethod::initialize(); Variable a{2}, b{3}, c{4}; Plus d{a, b}; Times e{d, c}; postfix(e, std::cout); std::cout << \" = \" << e.value() << \"\\n\"; // 2 3 + 4 * = 20 } Note that virtual_ is not used in the overrider. It is just a decorator used in the method. It is also removed from the method’s signature. BOOST_OPENMETHOD generates: inline auto postfix(const Node& node, std::ostream& os) -> void { // examine the type of node // select an overrider // call it } By itself, virtual_ does not provide any benefits. Passing the virtual argument by reference almost compiles to the same code as creating a virtual_ptr, using it for one call, then throwing it way. The only difference is that the virtual argument is passed as one pointer instead of two. However, we can now customize how the vptr is obtained. When the method sees a virtual_ parameter, it looks for a boost_openmethod_vptr function that can be called with the virtual argument (passed by const reference) and a pointer to a registry, and returns a vptr_type. If one is found, it is called to acquire the vptr. In the following example, we embed the vptr in the object, just like the vptr for native virtual functions. The v-table for a registered class can be found via a variable template static_vptr, nested in class default_registry. Classes used in virtual_ parameters need not be polymorphic, in the C++ sense. This time we implement value as an open-method. Nodes don’t have any virtual functions anymore. struct Node { boost::openmethod::vptr_type vptr; using registry = boost::openmethod::default_registry; // short alias friend auto boost_openmethod_vptr(const Node& node, registry*) { return node.vptr; } Node() { vptr = registry::static_vptr<Node>; } }; struct Variable : Node { Variable(int value) : v(value) { vptr = registry::static_vptr<Variable>; } int v; }; struct Plus : Node { Plus(const Node& left, const Node& right) : left(left), right(right) { vptr = registry::static_vptr<Plus>; } const Node& left; const Node& right; }; struct Times : Node { Times(const Node& left, const Node& right) : left(left), right(right) { vptr = registry::static_vptr<Times>; } const Node& left; const Node& right; }; #include <boost/openmethod/initialize.hpp> using boost::openmethod::virtual_; BOOST_OPENMETHOD(value, (virtual_<const Node&> node), int); BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE(value, (const Variable& var), int) { return var.v; } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE(value, (const Plus& plus), int) { return value(plus.left) + value(plus.right); } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDE(value, (const Times& times), int) { return value(times.left) * value(times.right); } BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Node, Variable, Plus, Times); auto main() -> int { boost::openmethod::initialize(); Variable a{2}, b{3}, c{4}; Plus d{a, b}; Times e{d, c}; std::cout << value(e) << \"\\n\"; // 20 } A call to value: int call_value(const Node& node) { return value(node); } …​compiles to: mov rax, qword ptr [rdi] mov rcx, qword ptr [rip + value::fn+88] jmp qword ptr [rax + 8*rcx] # TAILCALL inplace_vptr_base and inplace_vptr_derived automate the creation and management of embedded vptrs. They are both CRTP mixin classes. inplace_vptr_base is used at the root of a hierarchy. It defines a vptr member variable, and a boost_openmethod_vptr friend function that returns its value - just like in the previous example. inplace_vptr_derived is used in derived classes. Their constructors set the vptr member to point to v-table for the class. WARNING inplace_vptr_derived must be used at each level of the hierarchy, and reflect the actual inheritance relationships. Otherwise, the vptrs will not be set correctly, and the wrong overriders may be called. struct Node : boost::openmethod::inplace_vptr_base<Node> { }; struct Variable : Node, boost::openmethod::inplace_vptr_derived<Variable, Node> { Variable(int value) : v(value) {} int v; }; struct Plus : Node, boost::openmethod::inplace_vptr_derived<Plus, Node> { Plus(const Node& left, const Node& right) : left(left), right(right) {} const Node& left; const Node& right; }; struct Times : Node, boost::openmethod::inplace_vptr_derived<Times, Node> { Times(const Node& left, const Node& right) : left(left), right(right) {} const Node& left; const Node& right; }; The rest of the program is as before, except that BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES needs not be called: inplace_vptr_base and inplace_vptr_derived take care of registering the classes and their inheritance relationships. inplace_vptr_derived supports multiple inheritance: more than one base class can be listed after the class being defined. The destructor of inplace_vptr_derived set the bases' vptrs back to the v-table for the bases, just like what C++ does for its native vptrs. inplace_vptr_base and inplace_vptr_derived are aliased in namespace boost::openmethod::aliases.

Id is a type, typically an incomplete class declaration named after the method's purpose. It is used to allow different methods with the same signature. Fn is a function type, i.e. a type in the form ReturnType(Parameters...). Registry is an instantiation of class template registry. Methods may use only classes that have been registered in the same registry as virtual parameters and arguments. The registry also contains a set of policies that influence several aspects of the dispatch mechanism ‐ for example, how to acquire a v‐table pointer for an object, how to report errors, whether to perform sanity checks, etc. The default value for Registry is default_registry, but it can be overridden by defining the preprocessor symbol {{BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY}}, before including <boost/openmethod/core.hpp>. Setting the symbol afterwards has no effect. Specializations of method have a single instance: the static member fn, which has an operator() that forwards to the appropriate overrider. It is selected in the same way as overloaded function resolution: 1. Form the set of all applicable overriders. An overrider is applicable if it can be called with the arguments passed to the method. 2. If the set is empty, call the error handler (if present in the registry), then terminate the program with abort. 3. Remove the overriders that are dominated by other overriders in the set. Overrider A dominates overrider B if at least one of its virtual formal parameters is more specialized than B's, and if none of B's virtual parameters is more specialized than A's. 4. If the resulting set contains exactly one overrider, call it. If a single most specialized overrider does not exist, the program is terminated via abort. If the registry contains an error_handler policy, its error function is called with an object that describes the error, prior calling abort. error may prevent termination by throwing an exception. For each virtual argument arg, the dispatch mechanism calls virtual_traits::peek(arg) and deduces the v‐table pointer from the result, using the first of the following methods that applies: 1. If result is a virtual_ptr, get the pointer to the v‐table from it. 2. If boost_openmethod_vptr can be called with result and a Registry*, and it returns a vptr_type, call it. 3. Call Registry::rtti::dynamic_vptr(result). If Registry was initialized with the N2216 option, ambiguous calls are not an error. Instead, the following extra steps are taken to select an overrider: 1. If the return type is a registered polymorphic type, remove all the overriders that return a less specific type than others. 2. If the resulting set contains only one overrider, call it. 3. Otherwise, call one of the remaining overriders. Which overrider is selected is not specified, but it is the same across calls with the same arguments types.

Name Description default_registry Default registry. Methods exist in the context of a registry. Any class used as a method or overrider parameter, or in as a method call argument, must be registered with the same registry. Before calling a method, its registry must be initialized with the initialize function. This is typically done at the beginning of main. Multiple registries can co‐exist in the same program. They must be initialized individually. Classes referenced by methods in different registries must be registered with each registry. A registry also contains a set of policies that control how certain operations are performed. For example, the rtti policy provides type information, implements dynamic casting, etc. It can be replaced to interface with custom RTII systems (like LLVM's). Policies are implemented as Boost.MP11 quoted metafunctions. A policy class must contain a fn<Registry> template that provides a set of static members, specific to the responsibility of the policy. Registries instantiate policies by passing themselves to the nested fn class templates. There are two reason for this design. Some policies are \"stateful\": they contain static data members. Since several registries can co‐exist in the same program, each stateful policy needs its own, separate set of static data members. For example, vptr_vector, a \"vptr\" policy, contains a static vector of vptrs, which cannot be shared with other registries. Also, some policies need access to other policies in the same registry. They can be accessed via the Registry template parameter. For example, vptr_vector hashes type_ids before using them as an indexes, if Registry cotains a type_hash policy. It performs out‐of‐bounds checks if Registry contains the runtime_checks policy. If an error is detected, it invokes the error_handler policy if there is one. `Policy` must contain a `category` alias to its root base class. The registry may contain at most one policy per category. `Policy` must contain a `fn<Registry>` metafunction.

A virtual_ptr is a wide pointer that combines pointers to an object and its v‐table. Calls to methods via virtual_ptr are as fast as ordinary virtual function calls (typically two instructions). A virtual_ptr can be implicitly constructed from a reference, a pointer, or another virtual_ptr, provided that they are type‐compatible. virtual_ptr has specializations that use a std::shared_ptr or a std::unique_ptr as the pointer to the object. The mechanism can be extended to other smart pointers by specializing virtual_traits. A \"plain\" virtual_ptr can be constructed from a smart virtual_ptr, but not the other way around.

Declared in <boost/openmethod/policies/default_error_handler.hpp> struct default_error_handler : error_handler Name Description error_handler Policy for error handling. Name Description fn A ErrorHandlerFn metafunction. Wraps the error in a std::variant, and calls a std::function with it. The function object is initialized to a function (default_handler) that writes a description of the error, using the output policy, if it is available in the registry. This is the error handler used by the default registry. In debug variants, it writes an error message to stderr, then returns. In release variants, no message is emitted. Any call by the library to the error policy is immediately followed by a call to abort. By default, the library is exception‐agnostic: it is exception‐safe, but it does not throw exceptions by itself.
