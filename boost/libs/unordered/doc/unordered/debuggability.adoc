== Visual Studio Natvis

All containers and iterators have custom visualizations in the Natvis framework, as long as their allocator uses regular raw pointers. Any container or iterator with an allocator using fancy pointers does not have a custom visualization right now.

The visualizations mirror those for the standard unordered containers. A container has a maximum of 100 elements displayed at once. Each set element has its item name listed as `[i]`, where `i` is the index in the display, starting at `0`. Each map element has its item name listed as `[\{key-display}]` by default. For example, if the first element is the pair `("abc", 1)`, the item name will be `["abc"]`. This behaviour can be overridden by using the view "ShowElementsByIndex", which switches the map display behaviour to name the elements by index. This same view name is used in the standard unordered containers.

By default, the closed-addressing containers will show the `[hash_function]` and `[key_eq]`, the `[spare_hash_function]` and `[spare_key_eq]` if applicable, the `[allocator]`, and the elements. Using the view "detailed" adds the `[bucket_count]` and `[max_load_factor]`. Conversely, using the view "simple" shows only the elements, with no other items present.

By default, the open-addressing containers will show the `[hash_function]`, `[key_eq]`, `[allocator]`, and the elements. Using the view "simple" shows only the elements, with no other items present. Both the SIMD and the non-SIMD implementations are viewable through the Natvis framework.

Iterators are displayed similarly to their standard counterparts. An iterator is displayed as though it were the element that it points to. An end iterator is simply displayed as `\{ end iterator }`.
